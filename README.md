Repository for Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Introduction

This repository is the artifact of the Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree
Capstone Project. The project selected for this effort was to analyze and
generate predictive models for the Starbucks Offer Dataset where a corpus
of promotional offers are extended to a profile of customers and the customer
responses were recorded for a period of time. The customers personally
identifiable information has been obscured in order to allow distribution of
the dataset.

This project applies a full pipeline of data cleaning and feature 
transformation to the original dataset and provides some data analytics prior
to building a model pipeline and multi-model evaluation across several machine
learning prediction model approaches as well as the application of a fully
connected neural network.

## Getting Started

1. This repository is designed to work with python >= 3.6 and the following
   packages:
   * numpy >= 1.21.3
   * pandas >= 1.3.4
   * pytorch >= 1.8.0
   * scikit-learn >= 1.1.1
   * seaborn >= 0.11.2
   * black >= 22.3.0  # <- used for formatting
   * isort >= 5.10.1  # <- used for formatting
   * pytest >= 7.1.2  # <- used to testing code
2. Run the notebook `Starbucks_capstone_notebook.ipynb` and follow along
3. Associated code can be found within the `capstone_tools` module
4. Data can be found within the `data` directory
5. Docs related to the project are found within the `docs` directory
6. Models generated by the notebook will be placed within the `models`
   directory
